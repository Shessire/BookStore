<h2>My Book Collection CRUD Project</h2>
Welcome to my Book Collection CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project! This project showcases my journey in web development and my ability to create a functional web application using React, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL.
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>


This project allows you to manage a virtual book collection. You can add, view, update, and delete books from your collection, complete with book titles, descriptions, and even cover images. It's a simple yet effective demonstration of CRUD operations in a web application.

I developed this project by leveraging online learning resources and applying the knowledge I gained. Through this project, I had the opportunity to learn and practice:
<br>
<br>
<b>React:</b> Creating a user-friendly front-end interface.<br>
<b>Node.js and Express.js:</b> Building the back-end server for handling requests.<br>
<b>MySQL Database:</b> Storing and retrieving data efficiently.<br>
<b>CRUD Operations:</b> Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities.<br>
<b>State Management:</b> Managing the state of the application effectively.<br>
<b>UI Design:</b> Crafting a simple, user-friendly design for a smooth user experience.<br>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<b>I haven't deployed this project online because my database is not cloud-based.</b> However, the codebase demonstrates my coding skills and what I've learned in web development.

Thank you for checking out my project! I'm continuously learning and improving, and I'm excited to share this journey with you.
